About 2.5 years ago I found myself at a crossroads in my PhD program,
and decided to switch fields from materials science research
(nanophotonics and plasmonics) to computer science research (artificial
intelligence). I was captivated by the broad impact that areas like
AI could have, the entire world was (and still is) getting on mobile
phones, and I felt like my work would leave a larger dent. This was a
huge change for me - I'm an EE PhD and essentially went from hardware
to software search - and involved many learning curves.

I'm compiling below a condensed set of basic skills that helped me in my
transition, in the hope that those of you that are interested in such as
field switch might find it useful. This is very much a work in progress
and I welcome all comments and helpful suggestions!

General Topics:

1.  Useful hardware
  * mixed
  * mixed
2.  Working in a command-line environment
3.  Working with Linux and Unix-based operating systems
4.  Useful frameworks and codebases to learn
5.  Basic knowledge of algorithms
6.  Advanced Math Topics

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
